# Assignment

### Introduction
You are provided with the **3-links planar manipulator** shown in the sketch below,
whose link lengths **‚Ñì<sub>1</sub>**, **‚Ñì<sub>2</sub>**, **‚Ñì<sub>3</sub>** are all
equal and whose tip ùê∏ is identified by the triplet **[x<sub>e</sub>, y<sub>e</sub>, œÜ<sub>e</sub>]**,
being (x<sub>e</sub>, y<sub>e</sub>) the Cartesian coordinates of the tip, whereas œÜ<sub>e</sub>
is the angle between the link 3 and the x-axis of the root frame.

Moreover, the manipulator is actuated by means of 3 motors controlled in velocity that move
the joints angles **[Œ∏<sub>1</sub>, Œ∏<sub>2</sub>, Œ∏<sub>3</sub>]**.

### Goal
Design a controller by filling in the missing code in the [**`src/main.cpp`**](src/main.cpp)
module, which implements a suitable Inverse Kinematics algorithm to meet
the following requirements given in descending order of importance:
- :one: **Primary task**: reach the target position with the tip of the manipulator.
- :two: **Secondary task**: align the tip frame along with the target frame.

:point_right: The test will verify the capabilities of your controller in different
conditions, assigning **scores** according to the recorded performance, considering
in particular cases where the primary and secondary tasks cannot be achieved
at the same time or even cannot be fully completed.

:warning: In the latter setting, the test will evaluate the **best effort** made to
attain the primary task solely.

An example of a successful control is visible in the animation below:

While [running the script **test.sh**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-run-smoke-tests.md) in the **smoke-test** directory, you might find helpful resorting to the [`yarplogger`](http://www.yarp.it/yarplogger.html) utility to catch all the printouts produced through `yDebug`, `yWarning`, `yInfo` and the like. Thus, do the following:
- Make sure that `yarpserver` is running.
- Launch the `yarplogger`.
- Launch the smoke test.
